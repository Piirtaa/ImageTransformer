# ImageTransformer
A dotnet core executable for doing "pixel by pixel" image manipulation.  This demonstrates the use of decorator-like mutation of functionality fractally using both an actual decorator implementation but also decoration of strategy patterns.  

A use-case for this library would be cleaning up captcha images for subsequent OCR.
